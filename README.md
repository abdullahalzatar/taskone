- Git :

GitHub is a for-profit company offering a cloud-based Git repository that helps developers store, manage, track and control changes.

A GitHub repository can be used to store a development project.

It can contain folders and any type of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, Images).

A GitHub repository should also include a licence file and a README file about the project.

A GitHub repository can also be used to store ideas, or any resources that you want to share.
    
    - What I Understood (
        It is more like a remote control that can control 
        all the files in the project and also enables you 
        to push and pull files to any site you want)



- Html :

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation.
It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 

HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:

Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

    - What I Understood (
        It's like the skeleton of a website that enables 
        you to write and place the basic Tags)

- Css :

CSS uses a simple English based syntax with a set of rules that govern it. Like weâ€™ve mentioned before,
HTML was never intended to use style elements, only the markup of the page.
It was created to merely describe the content. For example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>. </p>

    - What I Understood (
       It is designed for HTML and enables you to (change 
       shapes, colors, size and ...))
